    <div class = "text">
    <p>Congratulations on making it this far in the SHSU Computing Science curriculum, you have now reached what many refer
        to as a filter class. COSC 3319 is one of the most challenging courses you will take,
         but it is not impossible to pass with a respectable grade.

        <p>Recommended actions:</p> 
        <ul style="font-size: 26px;">
            <li>Take the time to develop a study technique that works for you. If you have already done this, good job.</li>
            <li>Make time to study. <ul><li>While this may seem trivial, there are a surprising number of people who attempt
                COSC 3319 but do not make an effort to study
                </li></ul></li>
            <li>Get adequate sleep, nutrition, and hydration</li>
            <li>Go to class. <ul> <li>There will be many who complain about the difficulty
                of the course but do not go to class. Don't be one of those people</li>
                </ul>
            <li>Participate in the lecture, and do your best to ask meaningful questions. However, it is fine to ask questions
                that are somewhat trivial, like what the definition of a word is.
            </li>
            <li>Find a study group, and make sure these are people who want to concentrate as much as you do</li>

        </ul>
