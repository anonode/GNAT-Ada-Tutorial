    <div class = "txt">
    <p>To those who are reading this, this website is only meant to direct you to resources that have helped me get through the course.
       I do not find it necessary for me to create my own tutorials to teach the topics covered in COSC 3319, as there are many resources
       that already exist for that purpose.
    </p>
    <p>Data Structures and Algorithms is one of the more challenging courses you will take,
       but, despite the notoriety surrounding this study, it is entirely possible to pass this course with a good grade.
       One other thing I wish to note is that in order to succeed in this course, you need to be somewhat inquisitive. 
       There are going to be occasions where you, your peers, or whoever you associate with, are not going to
       know how to do something, and you will get stuck. While it is less time-consuming to google around for answers, you
       should first consider challenging yourself by attempting to solve whatever it is you are working on without any help.

        <p>General Tips</p> 
        <ul style="font-size: 26px;">
            <li>Take the time to develop a study technique that works for you</li>
            <li>Make time to study. <ul><li>While this may seem trivial, it is important that you give yourself the best chances at passing
                exams by studying material as early as you can. Do not cram. Given the low percentage of people who passed the course, I
                would say that cramming is probably not the most effective way of preparing for DSA test
                </li></ul></li>
            <li>Get adequate sleep, exercise, nutrition, and hydration</li>
            <li>If possible, go to class</li>
            <li>Participate in the lecture, and ask question if you have them
            </li>
            <li>Find a study group, and make sure these are people who want to concentrate as much as you do</li>
