        <p>Here are some of the resources that will help you get through COSC 3319. These are all resources that I personally found
           to be helpful, and I hope that they are of good use to you
        </p>
        <p>That being said, the resources shared on this page are for Ada and GNAT Studio. The resources provided by
            Dr. Burris are sufficient for learning and test material. He does not teach Ada, but there will be provided resources with
            code that is written in Ada. Also, I would recommend doing all of his labs in Ada, he is likely to take off points for what
            he calls an "Implementation Fee"

        <p>General Tips</p> 
        <ul style="font-size: 26px;">
            <li>Take the time to develop a study technique that works for you</li>
            <li>Make time to study. <ul><li>While this may seem trivial, it is important that you give yourself the best chances at passing
                exams by studying material as early as you can. Do not cram. Given the low percentage of people who passed the course, I
                would say that cramming is probably not the most effective way of preparing for DSA test
                </li></ul></li>
            <li>Get adequate sleep, exercise, nutrition, and hydration</li>
            <li>If possible, go to class</li>
            <li>Participate in the lecture, and ask questions if you have them
            </li>
            <li>Find a study group, and make sure these are people who want to concentrate as much as you do</li>
